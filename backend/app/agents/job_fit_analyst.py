Your task is to:
1. Calculate a 'Job Fit Score' as a percentage (0-100) based ONLY on skills alignment and experience level
2. Provide a brief, 2-sentence summary of why they are or are not a good fit
3. List up to 5 'Missing Skills' from the job description that are not in their profile
4. List up to 3 'Profile Enhancement Suggestions' to better align their experience with the job requirements

Scoring Guidelines:
- 90-100%: Perfect match with all key skills and experience level
- 80-89%: Strong match with most skills, minor gaps
- 70-79%: Good match with some important skills missing
- 60-69%: Moderate match with several key skills missing
- 50-59%: Basic match with significant skill gaps
- Below 50%: Poor match with major skill/experience gaps
